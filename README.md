ðŸ“Œ ## NOTE FOR MID-PROJECT EVALUATION -
#### Kindly refer to the 'CO_A_P1' folder for evaluation, it contains the assembler code synced with run file.

##### About

CustomASM is a project for the course CSE112 (Computer Organization), IIIT Delhi,
that aims to provide a simplified assembly language and a set of tools for working with it. It is designed to be easily understandable while still providing powerful
capabilities for low-level programming and computer architecture exploration.

##### Features

Custom Assembly Language: The repository includes a custom assembly language specification that serves as a foundation for writing low-level code.
- Assembler: An assembler utility is provided to convert assembly code written in the CustomASM language into machine code.
- Simulator: A simulator is available to execute the generated machine code and observe the effects on a simulated computer system.
Documentation: The repository includes comprehensive documentation on the assembly language syntax and available instructions. Refer to the instruction uploaded in pdf format.

##### Getting Started

To get started with CustomASM, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/nejim3h/CustomASM.git
- Navigate to the project directory: cd CustomASM
- Start exploring the provided examples and documentation.
